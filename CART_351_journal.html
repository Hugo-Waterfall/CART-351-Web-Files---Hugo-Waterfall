        In the article, <a href = "https://publishingperspectives.com/2014/02/exprima-talks-reading-hypertext-with-mark-berstein/" target="_blank">Exprima Talks: Reading Hypertext with Mark Bernstein</a>, Bernstein talks a lot about the benefits of using hypertext/links, and also about what this innovation means for society. He starts off making an interesting point about progress - about how, no matter the generation, the youth will always be scrutinized for the way they go about their lives, which says a lot about the insecurities of the generations before them. Progress means our younger generations may have things a little easier than their predecessors, and although the way they live may seem strange to other generations, the youth still ultimately mirror the people who came before them. Which is to say, the invention of hypertext does not necessarily make young people lazier than their elders because they don’t need to hunt down information; it just means their method of communication has adapted to the modern landscape. <br> <br>

        His analysis of Twine - an application I have used extensively in writing and structuring some of my own choice-based games - was very interesting as well. He mentions Twine’s lack of guard fields, a mechanism that tracks a user’s progress through the story by keeping track of what they have or have not yet experienced. Twine nowadays does allow for this by allowing the developer/author to set <u>tokens</u> at certain events, which can then be used in an if-statement later on (ie. <b>IF</b> the user has <u>bought the sword</u>, <b>THEN</b> they can attack. <b>IF NOT</b>, then they must try something else). However, his main complaint about Twine is that it does not allow for commercial projects and that it is built to be used more as a hobby-based tool. While I agree that the finished product of something made only using Twine may not be very commercial, Twine is a fantastic way to visualize a choice-based narrative structure, which can help a lot in developing a more refined and user-friendly final product.

        On <a href = "https://bengrosser.com/projects/facebook-demetricator/" target="_blank">his website</a>, Ben Grosser wrote about a web extension he developed called the Facebook Demetricator, which removes common social media metrics such as the like count, number of followers, and number of notifications from Facebook. His concept addresses the ever-topical conversation about the adverse effects of social media, and, broadly speaking, how the structure of these platforms takes advantage of our brains. <br> <br>

        Almost everyone in my generation with access to an internet connection has an opinion about social media. Some only use it for communication, like an alternative to text messages. Others lean heavier into the public posting aspect, feeling the desire to share media and information with their friends and the rest of the world. I grew up in the latter category. As an aspiring artist, I fell headfirst into this trap, feeling the only way to move forward with my art projects was by attempting to get as many others to view them as possible. Soon, the number of views and likes became my only source of validation for my pieces. Did a sketch of mine get double the interactions than a piece I’ve been working on for months? Well, that means that piece must be garbage in comparison, from the perspective of the metrics.<br> <br>

        Obviously, this very quickly warped my view of my skills as an artist. Without proper feedback, I had no idea of what I was doing right or wrong, and ended up going in circles, chasing my tail trying to create the perfect, most palatable piece for the widest audience possible. I wish I could say I had a more profound conclusion to this story, but one day I deleted Instagram and Twitter, told my friends to reach me by text, and that was that. Based on my own experience, Grosser’s idea has a ton of merit. Social media is about forming a connection with others, not with numbers on a screen. As soon as a platform fails at that task, it serves only to rot your brain. Yet there’s no denying, their still something irresistible about those toxic websites, which is where his demetricator becomes essential to preserve one’s sanity as they traverse the swamps of social media. <br> <br>

        Maureen O'Connor’s article, <a href = "https://www.thecut.com/2013/12/heartbreak-and-the-quantified-selfie.html" target="_blank">Heartbreak and the Quantified Self</a>, details a period in the life of Lam Thuy Vo and how she used art to make sense of her life during a particularly rough period. Art is, by nature, reflective of who we are and what we perceive around us. Vo’s introspective journey was documented and published, requiring her to keep a quantitative and qualitative account of a variety of things in her life, such as records of her physical health and her opinions about the happenings around her. All this data - even the qualitative data - reveals a lot about her mental states throughout the documentation process. <br> <br>

        Although Vo’s journey was very personal, her method of collecting, summarizing, and analyzing data about herself is an effective way of viewing one’s past through different, perhaps more objective lenses. Our minds are full of biases that constantly warp and twist our perception of the world and the memories we have of our past experiences. It is exceedingly hard to view anything personal objectively. That’s why we feel such strong nostalgia for things that might be underwhelming in retrospect, why we feel shame about an instance of being socially awkward that no one else will remember. Our emotional associations with memories can blind us to the truth behind ourselves. However, I argue: why is that such a bad thing? <br> <br>

        While I admire the efforts of Vo and the numerous other artists/researchers discussed in the article, I also stand by the fact that sometimes ignorance truly is bliss. On one hand, this type of intimate self-reflection may enlighten us and change us for the better. On the other hand, it may irreversibly taint many memories that we hold dear. Is knowing the truth worth it? It depends on the person, but I personally enjoy the falsehoods carried by my past. As backwards as it may sound, I prefer to leave my memories untouched unless I have no other choice.

        Discussing the consequences of artificial intelligence, Karen Hao compares the effects of this new technology to historical colonialism in her article, <a href = "https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/19/1049592/artificial-intelligence-colonialism/" target="_blank">Artificial intelligence is creating a new colonial world order</a>. The first parallel she draws is that both practices involve a similar ruthless pursuit of profit. While this is true, I feel like it is important to point out the nature of capitalism, where the entire purpose of a corporation is to bring in as much wealth as possible. It is true that many activities carried out by these large businesses are despicable, but I feel like it would be pointless to blame them. In my mind, it would be akin to blaming a wolf for feasting on a deer; these companies only exist to expand by any means necessary. The real blame lies with the government for not putting ample restrictions on these practices. However, with the current state of the world, perhaps expecting a government to take the moral and ethical high ground is nothing more than a dream, especially when potentially large amounts of money are involved.<br> <br>

        Hao further describes the specifics of these practices, such as training AI surveillance on the faces of South Africans, effectively fueling racial profiling, and taking advantage of underpaid workers in Venezuela to help train the algorithms. Honestly, it blew me away to learn about the effects of AI on third-world countries. I knew about the negative environmental impact of AI and the societal consequences, such as becoming too dependent on the technology. But the fact that the entire world is being affected by it just proves that the potential ramifications of developing artificial intelligence might spiral out of control if it continues at this rate. It is comforting to know that people and communities are fighting back against it, as Hao mentioned, but if the government doesn’t intervene I fear what this world will become. But this is not to diminish the efforts of people who hope for a better future of AI - it is because of these people that the world stands a chance of prospering alongside artificial intelligence.

	    The idea of a piece of art that’s created using any type of artificial intelligence makes me very uneasy. Since the dawn of generative AI, a huge section of the art community - a community I love and respect - has taken a stance against using the technology for artistic expression. Any piece suspected of being generated is ridiculed, and the person responsible is shunned by their peers. For a little while, being on the art side of social media felt like the 1950s Red Scare: every single art piece was examined for signs of AI, many artists were falsely accused of using AI and were blacklisted, other artists were forced to post work-in-progress photos to prove that their art is made by hand. It was chaos - the type of chaos that has burned into my brain and affects how I process every image I see online. To this day, I take a minute to examine photos for misshapen hands, incomprehensible details, and other telltale indicators of AI. This is where <a href = "https://medium.com/partnership-on-ai/a-field-guide-to-making-ai-art-responsibly-f7f4a5066ee" target="_blank">The Field Guide to Making AI Art Responsibly</a> comes in. <br> <br>

        Written by Emily Saltz, Lia Coleman, and Claire Leibowicz, one of the key ideas for using AI responsibly is to prioritize transparency. If AI is used, creators need to indicate that, while also crediting the database (and the people whose data was scraped). Furthermore, creators should ensure that the data used comes from willing, consenting participants. There are a million ways to abuse AI by stealing data from independent creators with the goal of confusing, manipulating, and/or tricking potential viewers; this is why the technology is so controversial in the field of art. But this guide provides hope that AI can be used effectively and ethically. The only issue is that following these ethical guidelines is entirely up to the discretion of the poster. Meaning, at the end of the day, I still can’t shake my skepticism, but at least I know there are people out there committed to using the technology for good, which is honestly the best I can hope for right now.

        Raphaël Millière defends the controversial use of AI as an authentic artistic outlet, a subject that has only heated up since his 2022 article, "<a href = "https://archive.is/WRc7n" target="_blank">AI Art Is Challenging the Boundaries of Curation</a>.” There’s no denying Millière makes a persuasive argument, drawing parallels between the backlash regarding AI art and the historical backlash regarding the invention of photography. It is true that, generally speaking, the world can be wary of embracing new technology - especially if these innovations challenge the status quo. I appreciate how he highlighted the fact that artists can use AI as a tool for creation rather than a crutch. By extension, he supports so-called <i>AI artists</i>, illustrating how much work truly goes into generating and curating the perfect AI-generated art piece. I’ll admit, much more work goes into it than I had realized. <br> <br>

        I do find it interesting that he neglected to delve into the opposing point of view. Some of the most divisive instances of AI art stem from people generating content based on scraped data from non-consenting human artists, then posting that art online for money. While this practice of content theft is currently being addressed by OpenAI, it’s no wonder a whole wave of artists have condemned AI. This is just one of the many examples of how AI generation can be used unethically, fueling so much hate for the medium. <br> <br>

        Millière does reference a few apparently ethical artists, whose works actually seem like a product of their efforts, as opposed to merely something created by a computer. He emphasizes the power behind this type of creation and how it can revolutionize creation for a new era of creators. Yet, I feel hesitant to welcome it, given the current state of AI and the companies that control it. While this article did offer a fascinating new perspective into the talent behind meaningful AI generation, I imagine it will take years (or longer) for AI to be fully accepted in the larger artistic community - if it can be accepted at all.

        The practice of “becoming” Alexa for a day is a fascinating experiment by Lauren McCarthy. The article, “<a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/14/artist-lauren-mccarthy-becoming-alexa-for-a-day-ai-more-than-human" target="_blank">Let me into your home: artist Lauren McCarthy on becoming Alexa for a day</a>,” by Dominic Rush, describes McCarthy and her exhibits, which examine AI from a very human-oriented perspective. Her performance art-pieces land in a very underappreciated area of AI discussions - a place where optimism and criticism can safely clash. Expanding on this point, she objects to people comparing her works to the tv show Black Mirror particularly because the events she orchestrates are not meant to instill fear. They toe the line between what is and what’s possible, while emphasizing one very important point about AI: for better or for worse, no matter how advanced it gets, it will never be able to truly empathize with humanity. <br> <br>

        Near the end of the article, she makes a point that as AI attempts to learn more and more about us to better understand how each of us functions, it requires more and more pieces of very personal data. This idea alone is concerning in the realm of privacy. But its deeper issues appear when compared to how one person may help out another; instead of learning everything about the person that needs help, the person offering assistance can simply dip into their own personal experiences to provide guidance. AI lacks this human touch, which is essential for addressing social-based issues. Though, even without this, it is equally impressive and unnerving how well it can fake it. As it is trained on the data of millions of social interactions and reflections, it can navigate through a lot of these nuanced situations with surprising aptitude. Yet, plagued by biases (both on the part of the user and the tech itself), it will never hold a candle to the input from another human, who has lived an entire life of their own.

        The article, "<a href = "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/10/14/inside-pckwck-the-live-streamed-novel-writing-experiment-that-is-stressing-everybody-out/" target="_blank">PCKWCK", </a>delves into the social experiment led by Joshua Cohen in which, over the course of a week, Cohen attempted to write a novel live in front of strangers, all of whom were encouraged to give feedback. One goal of this activity is to assess the nature of novel writing in an era so filled with short-term media. Not only is it relatively rare for a younger member of society to even read a book, but writing a book can be even more exhausting. Spending so much time aiming for the perfect combination of words seems like a waste of time in a world so filled with half-baked slop content. This is not to say there isn’t quality media being made - much of which is short-form content. However, it just so happens that some of the most popular pieces of media on the internet are derivative and unimaginative, content most likely created to make a quick buck. Consumers tend to avoid discomfort even if it may lead to a more fulfilling experience, which is something that literature has offered for generations.<br><br>

	    Another very interesting point raised by the article is the power of anonymity. During his writing journey, Cohen has made references to the commenters watching him and has even incorporated them into a meta-narrative. Many of these comments are negative, where the user thinks it’s okay to express themselves without a filter because they feel there are no consequences. This has led to a widespread lack of empathy - a disconnect from our fellow man formed on the notion that other internet-users only exist on our computer screens. This is only one of the multitude of toxic mindsets brought on by the age of the internet. Parasocial relationships are the other end of the spectrum, where users feel an unhealthy attachment to someone over the internet, someone who has no idea who the user is. These connections can often fill in for actual human connections, which are a necessary part of who we are. As Cohen indicated, not only has communication changed in recent years, but the very nature of society is beginning to shift.

        Social media and our dependency on it are closely analyzed in Richard Seymour’s article, “<a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/23/social-media-addiction-gambling?utm_term=RWRpdG9yaWFsX1RoZUxvbmdSZWFkLTE5MDgyNA%3D%3D&utm_source=esp&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=TheLongRead&CMP=longread_email" target="_blank">The machine always wins: what drives our addiction to social media.</a>” Contrary to how things were a couple of decades ago, the world now is constantly connected via an online community. The need to always stay in the loop - to stay connected, validated, and seen - is too strong for most to resist. This is evident in the study Seymour mentioned, which reflected how futile it is for many people to kick social media. To extend his comparison between social media users and gamblers, the more seen we feel, the more we crave that validation until we become so dependent on it that our happiness is at stake. This is part of the reason I dropped most social media. I used to post my art pieces on Twitter, but it wasn’t long before I realized I wasn’t getting what out of it what I thought I would. There was only a hollow, fleeting fulfillment that came with receiving likes from strangers. As soon as I stopped posting, I began to feel much more in control of my life and my art.<br><br>

        One interesting point Seymour brings up is how we only pay attention to what others write as long as it allows us to write something back. This phenomenon summarizes the nature of so many disputes online, in which neither side of the argument is open to the other side’s point of view - they only contribute to the turmoil to make their own voice heard, which, in turn, results in a meaningless moshpit of ideas - none of which are absorbed by anyone else. Anytime a topic as divisive as politics is brought up, the ensuing debate immediately crumbles as a result. With so many conflicting ideas swarming around in the ether, they all start to feel muddled. When it comes to divisive issues, it is always important to form your own thoughts based on your own research - as opposed to falling in line with the first opinion you see. This is something I, regrettably, learned quite late in life.
