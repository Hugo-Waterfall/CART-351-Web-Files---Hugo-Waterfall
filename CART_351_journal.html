        In the article, <a href = "https://publishingperspectives.com/2014/02/exprima-talks-reading-hypertext-with-mark-berstein/" target="_blank">Exprima Talks: Reading Hypertext with Mark Bernstein</a>, Bernstein talks a lot about the benefits of using hypertext/links, and also about what this innovation means for society. He starts off making an interesting point about progress - about how, no matter the generation, the youth will always be scrutinized for the way they go about their lives, which says a lot about the insecurities of the generations before them. Progress means our younger generations may have things a little easier than their predecessors, and although the way they live may seem strange to other generations, the youth still ultimately mirror the people who came before them. Which is to say, the invention of hypertext does not necessarily make young people lazier than their elders because they don’t need to hunt down information; it just means their method of communication has adapted to the modern landscape. <br> <br>

        His analysis of Twine - an application I have used extensively in writing and structuring some of my own choice-based games - was very interesting as well. He mentions Twine’s lack of guard fields, a mechanism that tracks a user’s progress through the story by keeping track of what they have or have not yet experienced. Twine nowadays does allow for this by allowing the developer/author to set <u>tokens</u> at certain events, which can then be used in an if-statement later on (ie. <b>IF</b> the user has <u>bought the sword</u>, <b>THEN</b> they can attack. <b>IF NOT</b>, then they must try something else). However, his main complaint about Twine is that it does not allow for commercial projects and that it is built to be used more as a hobby-based tool. While I agree that the finished product of something made only using Twine may not be very commercial, Twine is a fantastic way to visualize a choice-based narrative structure, which can help a lot in developing a more refined and user-friendly final product.
